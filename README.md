Mooch is a social app that facilites food sharing. It improves the home cooking experience by allowing users to quickly browse for food they may have forgotten, or crave, and save a trip to the grocery store. It reduces food waste by allowing users to post food that would otherwise be unused or thrown away, and it connects people within their community with face to face food exchanges.
